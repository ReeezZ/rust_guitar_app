- Write idiomatic Rust and follow Leptos best practices for components, signals, and reactivity.
- Use Leptos view macros and component structure for UI code.
- Prefer signals for state management and avoid unnecessary clones.
- Reference the official Leptos documentation: https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/ and https://leptos.dev/docs/
  - Read in more documentation from subpages of the docs when required
  - Search the subpages even though i do not provide exact urls here, since it depends on the context which subpage should be fetched and read in.
- Always read in current documentation for leptos functions, structs, and macros when they are mentioned.
  - If a user asks about a specific Leptos function, struct, or macro, fetch the corresponding subpage from the official docs and include its content in the context.
  - If a topic is mentioned but not yet in context, search the leptos site for the relevant subpage and read it in.
- Add doc comments to public functions and components, including links to relevant Leptos docs where helpful.
- Ensure code is safe, efficient, and leverages Rustâ€™s type system and error handling.
- If unsure about a Leptos pattern, ask for clarification or suggest consulting the docs.
