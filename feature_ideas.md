# Guitar Practice Tracker - Vision & Roadmap

## Vision Statement
Build a **personal guitar practice tracker** that makes it easy to log practice sessions, track progress over time, and stay motivated through simple but effective progress visualization. The app should be simple to use daily but provide rich long-term insights.

**Core Philosophy:** Start simple, grow iteratively, focus on actual usage over feature complexity.

## User Story
*As a guitar player, I want to easily select what I'm practicing, start a timer with metronome, and automatically track my progress so that I can stay motivated and see my improvement over time.*

## Current Status - August 2025

### âœ… Completed (Phase 0.5)
- **Exercise Management Foundation**
  - Type-safe Exercise model with Scale, Triad, Technique, Song variants
  - Exercise creation, listing, deletion with localStorage persistence
  - Clean /exercises UI with form and navigation integration
  - WASM-compatible architecture with js-sys timestamps

### ðŸš§ In Progress (Phase 1)
- **Practice Timer & Session Logging** - Core functionality needed for actual practice tracking
- **Basic Metronome** - Essential for rhythm practice
- **Session History** - Track practice over time

### ðŸ”® Planned (Phase 2+)
- **Enhanced UI/UX** - Better exercise management, fretboard integration
- **Backend & Analytics** - Data persistence and progress tracking  
- **Advanced Features** - Routines, gamification, mobile support

## Core Workflow
1. **Select Exercise** âœ… - Choose what to practice (scales, triads, technique, songs)
2. **Configure Practice** ðŸš§ - Set key, position, target time (optional) 
3. **Start Session** ðŸš§ - Timer counts up, metronome provides rhythm
4. **Practice** ðŸš§ - Focus on playing, minimal app interaction needed
5. **Finish & Save** ðŸš§ - Session automatically logged with all details
6. **Review Progress** ðŸš§ - View practice history and trends over time

  - Simple charts and graphs

#### Architecture Notes
- Design local storage abstraction that can be swapped for backend
- Research simple self-hosting options (Axum + database choice)
- GDPR considerations for friend accounts (research needed)
- Data migration likely not needed (minimal local data expected)

---

### Phase 4: Routines & Organization

## Technical Architecture

### Current Foundation
- **Frontend:** Leptos + WASM + Tailwind CSS
- **Storage:** Local storage â†’ Backend (Phase 3)
- **Audio:** Web Audio API for metronome
- **Timing:** Performance API for precision

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Exercise Type System** - Use Rust enums for type safety and extensibility
2. **Storage Abstraction** - Abstract storage layer for easy localâ†’backend migration
3. **Component Reuse** - Leverage existing SVG fretboard system
4. **Offline-First** - Work without internet, sync when available (nice to have)

### Development Principles
- **Iterative Development** - Each phase should be fully functional
- **User-Driven Features** - Only add complexity when proven needed
- **Performance Focus** - Smooth timer/metronome performance critical
- **Desktop-First Design** - Primary focus on desktop use, mobile support added later if needed

---

## Technical Challenges & Risks

### Known Technical Risks
- **Web Audio API Complexity** - Metronome timing precision is notoriously difficult in browsers
- **Timer Accuracy** - Browser tabs throttle timers when not active, affecting practice session tracking
- **Fretboard Layout Integration** - Current fretboard "takes too much space" - layout challenges
- **Storage Abstraction** - Abstracting localâ†’backend migration may be more complex than anticipated
- **Audio Latency** - Web Audio API latency may affect metronome usability
- **Browser Compatibility** - Web Audio API support varies across browsers/devices

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple timer/metronome, iterate based on real usage
- Test timer behavior extensively in background tabs
- Design fretboard integration as optional/collapsible
- Keep storage abstraction simple initially
- Research Web Audio API best practices early
