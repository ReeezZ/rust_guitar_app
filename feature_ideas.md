# Guitar Practice Tracker - Vision & Roadmap

## Vision Statement
Build a **personal guitar practice tracker** that makes it easy to log practice sessions, track progress over time, and stay motivated through simple but effective progress visualization. The app should be simple to use daily but provide rich long-term insights.

**Core Philosophy:** Start simple, grow iteratively, focus on actual usage over feature complexity.

## Technical Architecture

### Current Foundation
- **Frontend:** Leptos + WASM + Tailwind CSS
- **Storage:** Local storage â†’ Backend (Phase 3)
- **Audio:** Web Audio API for metronome
- **Timing:** Performance API for precision

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Exercise Type System** - Use Rust enums for type safety and extensibility
2. **Storage Abstraction** - Abstract storage layer for easy localâ†’backend migration
3. **Component Reuse** - Leverage existing SVG fretboard system
4. **Offline-First** - Work without internet, sync when available (nice to have)

### Development Principles
- **Iterative Development** - Each phase should be fully functional
- **User-Driven Features** - Only add complexity when proven needed
- **Performance Focus** - Smooth timer/metronome performance critical
- **Desktop-First Design** - Primary focus on desktop use, mobile support added later if needed

---

## Technical Challenges & Risks

### Known Technical Risks
- **Web Audio API Complexity** - Metronome timing precision is notoriously difficult in browsers
- **Timer Accuracy** - Browser tabs throttle timers when not active, affecting practice session tracking
- **Fretboard Layout Integration** - Current fretboard "takes too much space" - layout challenges
- **Storage Abstraction** - Abstracting localâ†’backend migration may be more complex than anticipated
- **Audio Latency** - Web Audio API latency may affect metronome usability
- **Browser Compatibility** - Web Audio API support varies across browsers/devices

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple timer/metronome, iterate based on real usage
- Test timer behavior extensively in background tabs
- Design fretboard integration as optional/collapsible
- Keep storage abstraction simple initially
- Research Web Audio API best practices early
