# üé∏ Rust Guitar Practice App

A guitar learning companion built with **Rust**, **Leptos**, and **Axum** (to be implemented). Features interactive SVG fretboard visualization, practice exercises (working PoC), session tracking (in development).

## Quick Start

## üìã Development Commands

The `./x` script makes development easy:

```bash
./dev           # Start dev server
cargo test      # Run all tests
cargo check     # Code quality checks
cargo build     # Production build
cargo clippy    # linting
```

**VS Code Integration:** Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí pick a task


## Current Features

- **Exercise Management** - Create, edit, and organize practice exercises
  - To be changed, exercises like scales should not need to created manually
  - Maybe something like generate the exercise id of those from their configuration
- **SVG Fretboard System** - Scalable and interactive fretboard display
- **Scale Visualization** - Display scales with different note highlighting  
- **Configurable** - Support for different instruments and fret ranges



## üéØ What's Next

**Frontend ‚Üî Backend Integration**

- Read how to do this properly in the [Leptos Book](https://book.leptos.dev/ssr/21_cargo_leptos.html)
- Convert project to ssr application
  - For long term mobile compatibility (sending notifications for practice reminder) a pwa should work with ssr 
    - Should do a more thorough analysis at some point of this
  - Alternatives are csr with tauri
  - or switching entirely to dioxus 


### Future Ideas

#### Fretboard Training Exercises
- Switch english and german note system
- Find notes on the fretboard
- Find interval of note
- Find scales
- Find chord shapes (relative to a given note)
- Show scales (triads, modes)

#### Circle of Fifths
Interactive circle of fifths with drag & drop exercises:
- Fill empty circle of fifths
- Place scales in correct positions
- Increasing difficulty with specific ordering requirements

#### Advanced Features
- **Tuner** - Audio input for tuning assistance
- **Metronome** - Configurable drum beats and timing
- **Ear training** - Audio-based exercises
- **Chord book** - Progress tracking for chord knowledge
- **Chords in a key** - Key-based chord relationships
- **MIDI/Keyboard input** - Use keys 1-7 to play scale degrees


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Options

### Option 1: VS Code Dev Container (Recommended)
1. Install VS Code + Docker + Dev Containers extension
2. Clone repo and open in VS Code
3. `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"
4. Run `./x dev`

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install Rust + tools
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install trunk

# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/ReeezZ/rust_guitar_app.git
cd rust_guitar_app
./dev
```
